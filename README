Java Regular Expression Tool

Provides a handy user interface for processing a chunk of text with regular expressions (using Java's regular expression engine).

It is currently functional but was knocked up quick and dirty and the code is a bit of a mess and awaiting a cleanup.

The main utility is provided by the RegexTool class.

JSedFrame is an alternate user interface that allows you to 'queue' up replacements regexes.  This was an attempt create a replacement for sed scripts that was easier to use.
